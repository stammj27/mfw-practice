        <h4>Hi! I'm Jacob Stamm, and I am a professional property manager for Central City Properties, in Fresno, California. I currently live with my sister and her husband in Kingsburg, California.<br>
        I am a little unsure how much you want me to talk about myself, or how much you want to read, so I'm just going to go into the whole. Five Facts About Me... thing.<br>
        1.) I play a lot of video games. I used to play over eight hours a day, but, uh, I was told that was unhealthy, so I have since cut it down to four, except for on the weekends. Or when I finish my house work early. I still play eight hours of video games a day.<br>
        2.) I am a fan of professional wrestling. My favorite wrestler is Bray Wyatt, although I will admit he's not the best, like, actual wrestler.<br>
        3.) I am a dingle darn nerd, and usually one weekend a month, I go LARPing with my friends, though that's really just an excuse to whap my friends with a big ol' foam hammer.<br>
        4.) I am Yellow/Purple colorblind, although I feel like I only have trouble with yellow. Every time I have had my colorblindness explained to me, my optometrist explained it differently, so I don't know how to explain how I see color, other than sometimes shades of yellow either look white, or purple.<br>
        5.) I was almost going to become one of those guys who eats food fast for money, but then figured out that doing that, along with playing eight hours of video games a day, is not the healthiest way to live my life.<br>
        </br>
        This was the only picture I had of me on my computer, and the funniest way to use it, forgive me.
